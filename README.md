## Why CyclicalFileWatcher

Unlike another file watching solutions that rely on OS-level tools or native file system event hooks, **CyclicalFileWatcher** uses a simple polling mechanism to detect changes.  

This approach:

- Works consistently across platforms and environments (e.g. Docker, network drives, cloud volumes).
- Requires no external dependencies, system utilities, or file system support.
- Gives you full control over polling intervals and error handling.

Itâ€™s ideal for scenarios where reliability and isolation from the underlying OS are more important than real-time change detection.

## Usage

```csharp
var fileWatcher = new CyclicalFileWatcher<FileObject>(configuration);

await fileWatcher.WatchAsync(parameters, cancellationToken);

await fileWatcher.SubscribeAsync(filePath, async _ =>
{
    Console.WriteLine("Subscription action executed");
}, cancellationToken);

var latestFile = await fileWatcher.GetLatestAsync(filePath, cancellationToken);
```
